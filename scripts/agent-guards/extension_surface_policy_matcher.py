extension_surface_policy_matcher.py

Shared evaluator (Issue #2290) that reads
``docs/dev/extension-surface-runtime-policy.yaml`` (schema_version v2) and
determines whether an Issue's declared ``## Allowed Paths`` are syntactic
candidates for one or more of the policy's risk-trigger rules.

Scope (Issue #2290 In Scope / Out of Scope -- see Issue body):

- This module performs **candidate discovery only** -- a deterministic,
  syntactic comparison between the declared Allowed Paths and the policy's
  ``selectors[].source_scope: project`` ``path_globs``. It never performs a
  semantic diff judgment of actual PR changes (that consumer is explicitly
  Out of Scope for Issue #2290; see the ``pr-review-judge`` / impl-review-loop
  follow-up referenced in the Issue body).
- Exact Allowed Path entries (no ``*`` character) are matched directly
  against a rule's ``path_globs`` using the same matcher-v2 segment grammar
  as ``scripts/agent-guards/changed_file_matcher.py``'s ``AllowedPathsMatcher``
  (``*`` = one path segment, ``**`` = zero or more segments).
- Wildcard Allowed Path entries are intentionally **not** run through a full
  glob-intersection engine. Instead this module performs a conservative
  literal/static-prefix comparison: it is not permissible to design this in
  a way that risks missing a real risk-trigger candidate (false negative);
  over-flagging a candidate that a human later dismisses (false positive) is
  the accepted, safe side of the trade-off.

Consumers (``.claude/skills/review-issue/scripts/check_issue_contract.py`` and
``.claude/skills/issue-contract-review/scripts/contract_readiness_check.py``)
MUST dynamically load this module via ``importlib`` -- mirroring the existing
pattern in
``.claude/skills/issue-contract-review/scripts/declared_path_overlap.py``,
which dynamically loads ``scripts/agent-guards/changed_file_matcher.py`` the
same way -- rather than introducing a new static import boundary / Python
package (Issue #2290 "Notes for Reviewer").

    Grouping is by ``verification_profile`` id, not by individual matched
    rule: if the *same* profile is reached by more than one matched rule
    (possible when a policy fixture declares two distinct rules that both

    """Best-effort extraction of a single top-level RVA field's value.

    The ``## Runtime Verification Applicability`` section is not guaranteed
    to be a single well-formed YAML document as a whole -- existing Issue
    bodies mix bullet-list prose lines (``- decision: immediate``) with bare
    ``key: value`` lines, both inside and outside a ```` ```yaml ```` fence
    (e.g. ``- decision: immediate`` followed by ``applicable_acs: [AC1]`` at
    the same indentation is not one valid YAML document). To stay robust
    against this without inventing a new markup convention, this function
    locates only ``field_name``'s own line plus its nested block (lines
    indented strictly deeper than the field, blank lines included) and
    parses *that* isolated slice as its own tiny YAML document -- never the
    whole section. Returns ``None`` if the field is absent or its isolated
    slice fails to parse (never raises -- a missing/malformed field degrades
    to "absent", the same as every other RVA field check in this codebase).

    Issue #2771 PR #2780 OWNER F1 review fixed 3 false-negative patterns
    beyond the original "strictly deeper indent" design:

    - A trailing YAML comment on the field's own key line
      (``field_name: # comment``) is stripped before deciding whether an
      inline value is present (see ``_strip_unquoted_yaml_comment``).
    - A ``field_name:`` key followed by a block sequence at the *same*
      indentation (the shape PyYAML's own ``yaml.safe_dump()`` emits for a
      mapping value that is a list -- valid YAML; a sequence item does not
      need to be indented deeper than its mapping key) is now recognised as
      that field's nested block, provided the key line itself was matched
      in its plain (non-bullet) form. This same-indent continuation is
      deliberately NOT applied when the key itself was bullet-prefixed
      (``- field_name:``), because in that authoring style a *sibling*
      field at the same indentation is also written as a ``- other_field:``
      bullet -- applying the same-indent rule there would swallow the next,
      unrelated field into this one's value.
    - A ``field_name`` key that is itself written as a Markdown/YAML bullet
      item (``- field_name: value``), matching the existing authoring
      convention already used for other RVA fields such as ``- decision:``
      / ``- reason:``.

    This function performs STRUCTURAL COMPLETENESS checking only
    (structural_completeness_not_semantic_sufficiency): it verifies that
    every hard-required ``(verification_profile_id, assertion_id)`` pair is
    explicitly bound to a real, referentially-valid Acceptance Criterion via
    ``runtime_assertion_bindings``. It does not, and cannot, judge whether
    the bound VC actually *proves* the assertion's semantic postcondition
    (that remains existing semantic review's responsibility, Issue #2771
    Outcome / AC9 / AC10).

    Issue #2852: each binding carries a closed-enum ``disposition``
    (``dispositive`` / ``non_dispositive_readiness_compat`` /
    ``not_applicable``; legacy 3-field entries are ``dispositive`` with
    ``disposition_source: legacy_default``). Every disposition declares its
    own required key, but only that key: ``not_applicable`` / compat never
    hide another required assertion's ``missing`` nor any unknown /
    duplicate / malformed / invalid finding. The result exposes the
    classification (``classified_bindings`` and per-disposition assertion
    lists) and NO runtime-PASS-evidence field. ``evaluate_issue_risk_trigger``
    is intentionally unaffected (Issue-level decision requirements stay).

    ``ac_vc_refs`` is the caller-supplied, digit-only set of AC numbers that
    the ``## Verification Commands`` section references via a canonical
    ``# AC<N>`` comment (the same set already produced by the existing
    ``vc_contract_syntax.parse_verification_commands_section`` / C5 parser
    both consumers already import) -- passed in rather than re-parsed here
    so this module does not need a new cross-directory import dependency on
    top of its existing ``changed_file_matcher`` sibling import.

    Raises ``PolicyLoadError`` (propagated from
    ``derive_required_runtime_assertions``) for a policy integrity defect;
    callers MUST catch this separately from the returned ``verdict`` so an
    Issue-side declaration defect (``needs_fix``, returned normally) is
