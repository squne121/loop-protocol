"""Credentialless public GitHub REST read for Claude-GPT isolated sessions
(Issue #2241, hardened per PR #2247 human review).

This module exists so an isolated Claude-GPT session -- which intentionally
never receives the host's `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_CONFIG_DIR`
(Issue #2232 comment 5316900237 root cause) -- can still read a *public*
GitHub Issue (and its comments) in this repository without any
authentication. It is deliberately narrow:

  - GET only. There is no function anywhere in this module that constructs
    a request with any HTTP method other than GET. This is a hard,
    read-only boundary enforced at the source level, not a runtime flag.
  - Repository-bound. `TRUSTED_REPO_SLUG` is a fixed constant
    ("squne121/loop-protocol"); every read helper rejects any other
    repository slug before making a network call.
  - Never sends an `Authorization` header. Host credentials
    (`GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_CONFIG_DIR`) are neither read from
    nor forwarded into the request. `sanitized_env()` below documents and
    enforces this even for any future subprocess-based caller.
  - Never follows an HTTP redirect. `_RedirectRejectingHandler` makes every
    redirect (301/302/303/307/308, regardless of target host/scheme) a
    hard `CrossRepositoryReadRejected` instead of an implicit follow --
    GitHub Issue transfer between repositories is served as a redirect, and
    a follow would silently defeat the repository-bound check above
    (PR #2247 review P1-2).

Out of scope (Issue #2241 "Out of Scope" / Stop Conditions): a GET-only
authenticated read broker for higher rate limits. This module intentionally
accepts the anonymous GitHub REST rate limit (60 requests/hour per source
IP) until that limit is demonstrated to be insufficient for normal
workload -- at which point a follow-up Issue should design an authenticated
broker, not this module.

PR #2247 review P1-1 note: this module provides the credentialless
transport primitives (`read_public_issue`, `list_issue_comments`,
`CredentiallessGitHubReadTransport`). Wiring `run_refinement_preflight.py`'s
`_fetch_issue()` / `_fetch_issue_comments()` to select this transport under
an isolated-session profile requires editing
`.claude/skills/issue-refinement-loop/scripts/run_refinement_preflight.py`,
which is outside this Issue's Allowed Paths -- see the PR body "Not
controlled" section and the accompanying human-review reply comment.
