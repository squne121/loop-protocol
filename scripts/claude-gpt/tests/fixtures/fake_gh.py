"""Deterministic fake `gh` binary for Issue #2299 `runtime_smoke_test.sh
--scenario issue_create` (AC2/AC5), Issue #2273 P0-3/P1-4 producer/consumer
integration tests, and future create-issue fake-provider harnesses.

Understands the small, fixed subset of `gh` invocations that the
`create-issue` skill's dedupe step and `create_issue_txn.run_transaction()`
issue when labels/parent/dependencies are all empty: `gh issue list`
(dedupe search, any additional flags such as `--search`/`--state`/`--limit`/
`--json` are accepted and ignored beyond their presence), `gh issue create`,
and `gh api graphql` (node/database id readback); plus `gh auth status`,
`gh repo view`, and `gh issue comment`/`gh issue view` needed by the
`workflow_capability_preflight.py` <-> `root_entry_router.py`
producer/consumer integration tests (Issue #2273 P1-4). Any other invocation
is rejected with a non-zero exit so a scenario relying on unsupported `gh`
subcommands fails closed instead of silently no-op'ing.

`gh auth status` / `gh repo view` success is controlled via the
`FAKE_GH_AUTH_OK` / `FAKE_GH_REPO_READ_OK` environment variables (default:
both "1"/available) so tests can force a blocked capability preflight
without needing real GitHub credentials. When `FAKE_GH_AUTH_OK` is unset or
"1", `gh auth status` prints `Logged in to github.com account fake-test-user`
(matching real `gh` output) so ambient-auth preflight checks that parse this
line also pass.

Issue #2306 (AC2) additionally teaches this fixture: `--body`/`--body-file`
handling on `issue create`, `repo`/`state` persistence, `gh issue view
<number> --repo R --json fields` (used by `live_issue_create_canary.sh`
identity verification), `gh issue list --search Q --repo R --json fields`
title/repo-filtered fallback search, real `gh issue close` state mutation
(instead of the previous unconditional no-op), and a normalized `calls[]`
trace (operation / repo / primary subcommand only -- not exact argv, not
strict ordering, not exact-count assertions).

Fault-injection knobs (env vars, deterministic-test-only, never read by
production code):
  FAKE_GH_CLOSE_SHOULD_FAIL=1  -- `issue close` exits 1 without mutating state.
  FAKE_GH_CLOSE_NOOP=1         -- `issue close` exits 0 but leaves state
                                   unmutated (simulates a state-readback
                                   mismatch after an apparently successful
                                   close).

Issue #2306 follow-up (P1-d): `gh auth status` is now also understood (exits
0 and prints the ambient-auth success line unless `FAKE_GH_AUTH_OK=0`) so
`scripts/claude-gpt/tests/test_live_issue_create_canary.py`'s real-subprocess
`main()`/EXIT-trap tests (which run the unmodified production
`live_issue_create_canary.sh` -- not just its sourced helper functions --
against this fake `gh`) can pass the production script's `gh auth status
--hostname github.com` ambient-auth preflight check without touching real
GitHub auth, while Issue #2273's blocked-capability-preflight tests can still
force a failure via `FAKE_GH_AUTH_OK=0`.

State is persisted across invocations (each `gh` call is a fresh subprocess)
via a JSON file at $FAKE_GH_STATE.

Issue #2278 (`runtime_smoke_test.sh --scenario issue_to_impl`) additionally
teaches this fixture: `FAKE_GH_SEED_ISSUES_PATH` (a JSON file with the same
`{"next_number": int, "issues": {...}}` shape as the persisted state file,
consulted only when no `$FAKE_GH_STATE` file exists yet) so a fixture Issue
can be pre-seeded before any live `gh issue view` call, and a `labels` field
on `issue view`/`issue list` payloads (empty list when absent) so readers
that request `--json ...,labels,...` observe the same field shape real `gh`
returns.

Originally salvaged from the Issue #2259 bridge test fixture
(`.claude/worktrees/issue-2259-isolated-issue-create-bridge/scripts/
claude-gpt/tests/fixtures/fake_gh.py`, never merged to main) and adapted for
the native (non-bridge) live scenario harness (Issue #2299), then extended
for Issue #2306.

Issue #2433 additionally accepts only the fixed Issue REST API shapes emitted by
`controlled_skill_mutation_exec.py::issue_content.update`: GET with its fixed
`--jq` projection and exactly one title/body PATCH with `--input`. The fixture
persists `updatedAt` and a normalized API trace so the launcher smoke can prove
pre-read, one PATCH, and authoritative post-readback without becoming a generic
`gh api` fake.
