"""Issue #1734: issue-creator / issue-editor split — frontmatter and body contract tests.

Verifies AC1-AC4, AC8-AC10 from the live Issue #1734 contract:
- AC1/AC2: `tools` frontmatter is the exact set {Read, Bash} (no `Skill`) for
  issue-creator.md / issue-editor.md
- AC3/AC4: `skills` frontmatter is the exact set {create-issue} / {edit-issue}
- AC8: both agent bodies document the controlled-executor procedural contract
  and do not claim a technical Bash-tool-level denial of raw `gh issue`
  mutation
- AC9: both agent bodies document that both nested Skill invocation (no
  `Skill` tool) and nested SubAgent invocation (no `Agent` tool; e.g.
  issue-contract-fixer, Issue #998) are structurally impossible -- the
  earlier "distinct concept, does not block" claim is corrected and no
  longer asserted
- AC10: issue-editor.md retains the #995 FAIL_CLOSED_REWRITE_CONSTRAINTS_V1
  contract and documents the #1909 context_bundle_path forward-compat input
