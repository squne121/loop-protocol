"""Issue #2610: `root_review_pipeline.produce` outer timeout ownership.

Fresh 5-item inventory (execution surface / registry timeout consumer /
outer deadline owner / signal producer / process cleanup owner) performed
for this Issue found NO repository-owned consumer that actually reads and
enforces `command_registry.py`'s `root_review_pipeline.produce.timeout_seconds`
(90) as a real subprocess deadline: that command_id is not one of
`scripts/agent-guards/skill_runtime_command_policy.py`'s
`eligible_command_ids`, and `skill_runtime_exec.py` -- the only in-repo
reader of any REGISTRY entry's `timeout_seconds` -- therefore never
dispatches it (`test_ac1_*` below pins this down as a regression guard).

Per the Issue's own Runtime Verification Applicability `skip_conditions`,
this "no repository-owned consumer found" result means the AC2/AC3 "named
SSOT for a real in-repo consumer's outer deadline" production change is
OUT OF SCOPE for this file -- inventing a fictitious consumer, outer
watchdog, or persistent state just to exercise that code path would itself
violate this Issue's Stop Conditions (no new watchdog script / schema /
ledger / receipt / persistent state). This file instead covers what
remains fully in-scope regardless of consumer inventory result: AC1 (the
inventory finding itself, pinned as a regression guard), and AC4/AC5 (the
EXISTING, real timeout/cancellation/fail-closed semantics that already live
in `reviewer_transport.run_reviewer_transport()` -- the actual
SIGTERM->bounded grace->SIGKILL->reap implementation -- and in
`run_root_review_pipeline._cmd_produce()`'s fail-closed classification of a
transport failure). Both are exercised here via test-only production-shaped
fixtures (a real subprocess with a tiny injected deadline; no 90-second or
520-second real-time wait), per In Scope (g).
