"""
Tests for ISSUE_EXECUTION_DECISION_V1 in plan_refinement_loop.py output (#1677).

Covers:
- AC1: relations[] field present (machine-readable, array)
- AC2: execution.state / execution.predecessors / execution.defer_reason present
- AC3: downstream_policy block present with fixed values
- AC6: execution.state == selected fixture (requires a *complete*
  scope-rollup artifact confirming no collisions -- artifact absence no
  longer fails open to selected, PR #1767 owner review P0-1)
- AC7 / AC8: blocked / duplicate states are validated directly against the
  schema + normative semantic validator (construction bypasses the planner,
  since ISSUE_SCOPE_ROLLUP_PLAN_V2 heuristics are deliberately no longer
  converted into depends_on/duplicate/absorb relations -- PR #1767 owner
  review P0-2). Deriving these states from a genuinely reliable source
  (GitHub native dependency graph, explicit duplicate markers) is tracked as
  follow-up work, not implemented by this module.
- Negative tests (PR #1767 owner review P1-2): scope-rollup artifact
  absence/corruption does not fail open to selected; ambiguous
  sequential_required / merge_into_current_pr / human_review_required
  signals are never silently converted into a fabricated semantic relation.
