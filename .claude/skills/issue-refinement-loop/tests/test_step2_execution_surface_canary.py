"""Issue #2610 AC9: one-time, opt-in, read-only PRODUCER SMOKE canary for
the REAL canonical Step 2 execution surface (`root_review_pipeline.produce`)
against Issue #2584.

This is explicitly NOT a standing CI live-mutation gate (Out of Scope /
Runtime Verification Applicability skip_conditions). It never runs unless
the caller EXPLICITLY sets `LOOP_CANARY_STEP2_LIVE_ENABLE=1`. Absent
that (or when `gh` / `gh auth status` is unavailable), behaviour depends on
how pytest was invoked (Issue #2903), decided from pytest's resolved target
arguments (`config.args`), never from collected-item counts, failure counts
or raw command-line substrings:

- explicit STANDALONE runtime invocation (serial, resolved target is exactly
  this file or exactly this test's node-id): a line-start `SKIP:` stdout line
  (emitted through the public `capsys.disabled()` context so default output
  capture does not swallow it) followed by `pytest.exit(returncode=77)` per
  `docs/dev/runtime-verification-policy.md`'s SKIP convention (SKIP != PASS).
- every other shape (directory target, mixed targets, directory narrowed by
  `-k`, no target args, xdist worker): `pytest.skip()` on this item only, with
  no extra stdout, so a broad regression collection keeps running the other
  tests and still reports their independent failures.

Neither path ever makes a live GitHub call.

`root_review_pipeline.produce` is declared `mutation: False` in
`command_registry.py` -- it fetches the live Issue body (read-only), runs
local checkers, and persists local (gitignored) artifacts under
`.claude/artifacts/issue-refinement-loop/`; it never mutates Issue/PR state
on GitHub. This canary invokes it exactly once against Issue #2584 (the
Issue whose prior exit-143 incident triggered this Issue -- see #2610
"Related / Prior Art"), synchronously waiting for it to exit before making
any assertion.

IMPORTANT SCOPE CORRECTION (PR #2622 review comment 5617732209, P0): this
test is a **producer-level smoke test** -- a direct Python `subprocess`
invocation of `run_root_review_pipeline.py produce`, run and synchronously
awaited exactly once by this pytest test process. It never crosses, and is
not a stand-in for, Claude Code's REAL `run_in_background: true` execution
surface + background-task-completion-notification join used by the actual
SKILL.md Step 2 orchestrator. A plain `subprocess.run()`/`Popen().wait()`
inside a pytest test function is a synchronous, in-process wait -- it does
NOT exercise Claude Code's asynchronous background-task boundary (separate
tool-call lifecycle, completion notification delivered on a later turn,
etc.). Passing this test is therefore NOT evidence that SKILL.md's
background+join contract (Issue #2610 AC6) holds end-to-end; it is only
evidence about the producer script itself (below). The actual end-to-end
evidence for the background+join contract must come from a separate,
one-time, read-only canary run directly from Claude Code's main thread via
the Bash tool with `run_in_background: true`, joined by the real background
task completion notification -- that live run is out of scope for this
test file and is performed by the root/main thread, not by any pytest
process.

What THIS test actually proves, once live-enabled (Issue #2610 AC9 (1)-(4)):

1. The process was not killed by a signal at all (in particular not at the
   stale, unenforced 90-second registry boundary) -- a negative
   `returncode` on POSIX means the child was terminated by a signal.
2. This test's own synchronous wait for the child process to exit means no
   assertion proceeds until the real completed JSON has actually been read
   from stdout -- i.e. the producer script itself does not hang or crash
   when run to completion. (This is a same-process synchronous wait, not
   Claude Code's background-task join -- see the scope correction above.)
3. The emitted top-level `canonical_step2_route` is one of the closed set
   of real values `route_canonical_step2_result()` can return -- i.e. a
   genuine typed route (either an in-loop route or a genuine fail-closed
   classification), never a value this test invented.
4. On any non-`ok` `status`, the route MUST be exactly
   `fail_closed_environment_or_integrity_failure` -- this test asserts the
   ABSENCE of any fabricated `step_2_5` / approve / implementation
   authorization on the timeout/failure path; it never manufactures those
   itself.
