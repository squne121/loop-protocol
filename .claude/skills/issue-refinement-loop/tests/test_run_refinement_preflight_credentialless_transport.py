"""Read-transport selection regression coverage for
`run_refinement_preflight.py` (Issue #2241 AC8 / #2257, updated by #2872).

History: Issue #2241 routed an isolated Claude-GPT session (HOME != the OS
account home) to the credentialless REST transport
(`scripts/agent-guards/github_credentialless_read.py`) because the launcher
of that era never forwarded GitHub auth. Issue #2299 changed the launcher
contract: GitHub auth (an ambient `GH_CONFIG_DIR`, `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`/
`GH_HOST`/`GH_REPO`) is shared natively, so an isolated HOME says nothing
about GitHub auth. Issue #2872 therefore makes the production selector a
constant: native `gh`, always, for every read of one invocation.

This file keeps HOME isolation, GitHub auth availability and transport
selection as INDEPENDENT axes:

* the selector tests (isolated + token env / isolated + stored
  `GH_CONFIG_DIR` / isolated + authless / normal profile) pin that the
  transport never depends on either axis;
* the call-path tests (single transport threaded through every read,
  mid-read failure, multi-page comments + anchor) drive the real
  `run_preflight()` / `_fetch_*` functions with a recording transport;
* the remaining credentialless tests exercise the GET-only transport
  adapter through an EXPLICIT `transport=` argument -- it is no longer
  selected implicitly by any profile.

No test here reads, copies or prints a credential: token values are
sentinels and are asserted absent from every result.

Module loading follows the `test_operator_selected_scope_reframe.py`
convention (`importlib.util.spec_from_file_location` with a unique module
name, so this test never collides with another test file's own load of the
same source file in the same pytest session).
