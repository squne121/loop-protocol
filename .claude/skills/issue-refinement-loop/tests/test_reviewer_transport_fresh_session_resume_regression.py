"""Regression coverage for the fresh_session_replacement resume bug (#2352).

PR #2142 owner REQUEST_CHANGES P0-1 introduced ``build_backend_command()`` as
the single place that materializes same-session/fresh-session resume
identity into real backend argv. ``run_reviewer_transport()``'s retry loop
had a latent bug where a fresh-session-replacement ``RetryIntent`` (whose
``session_id`` is ``None`` by design -- see ``retry_matrix()``) was
incorrectly re-substituted with a synthetic UUID from
``generate_invocation_id()`` before being fed back into
``build_backend_command()`` as its next attempt's ``session_id``. This
caused a non-existent synthetic session id to be passed to ``--resume`` for
the Claude backend even though there is no real session to resume.

This test spies on ``build_backend_command()`` directly (not just the
fixture-backend ``attempts[N]["session_id"]`` field) so that it proves the
actual argv contract: a fresh-session-replacement attempt must be built
with ``session_id=None`` and its resulting argv must not contain
``--resume`` at all.
