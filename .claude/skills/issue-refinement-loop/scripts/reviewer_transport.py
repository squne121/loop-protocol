"""Parent-owned, fail-closed transport for issue-reviewer results.

The V2 compact wire is deliberately small, but it is *not* the authority for
the review result.  The parent creates an immutable attempt directory before
starting a child, records transport facts there, and accepts a semantic result
only after the same raw artifact bytes have passed all binding checks.

This module is the V2 contract owner.  Callers must not reimplement its
grammar, artifact layout, or retry policy.

PR #2142 owner REQUEST_CHANGES (P0-1/P0-2/P1-1/P1-2/P1-3): this revision adds
(a) ``build_backend_command()``, a single backend command adapter that
materializes same-session/fresh-session resume identity into real argv per
attempt (the child command is no longer identical across retries), (b)
``project_compact_v2_from_artifact()`` / ``verify_wire_matches_artifact()``,
which re-derive the canonical wire from a verified artifact's
``semantic_result`` so a caller can prove a (possibly separately relayed)
wire string still reflects that artifact -- hash/schema/repo/issue/body/
invocation/attempt binding on the artifact bytes alone does not prove this,
(c) a hard post-wait total-deadline check (late-result rejection), (d) a
bounded reader-thread join with an escaped-grandchild fault path, (e) an
exact ``os.open in os.supports_dir_fd`` capability gate, and (f) a
dir-fd-anchored, component-wise no-follow *write* path shared by every
producer so a symlinked intermediate directory cannot be silently followed
on create either.

# Issue #2165 (OWNER 2026-08-15 REQUEST_CHANGES, P1-1): these two constants
# previously assumed every attempt's wall time was governed only by
# transport-level concerns (spawn/signal/hang detection). In production the
# `deterministic` backend's single child process
# (`run_root_review_pipeline.py run-checker-attempt`) also executes the
# real checker chain synchronously inside that same attempt window --
# `check_issue_contract.py` -> `contract_readiness_check.py` (dominated by
# `baseline_vc_preflight.py` actually *running* every Verification Command
# in the reviewed Issue body) -> `merge_readiness`. The old
# PER_ATTEMPT_DEADLINE_SECONDS=90 could not fit even the single dominant VC
# call, so any Issue with a legitimately long-running VC deterministically
# timed out on every attempt; a later fix (PER_ATTEMPT=300/TOTAL=340) still
# undershot the layered ceiling those three subprocess calls' OWN
# independently-derived timeouts add up to (30 + 250 + 30 = 310 > 300).
#
# These module-level constants are now only a GENERIC FALLBACK for callers
# that do not pass an explicit `per_attempt_deadline`/`total_deadline`.
# `run_root_review_pipeline.py`'s `_cmd_produce()` (the deterministic
# backend's actual caller) derives and passes its OWN explicit values from
# `contract_readiness_check.CONTRACT_READINESS_CHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (which
# itself derives from `baseline_vc_preflight.py`'s per-VC-command cap, see
# that module's Issue #2165 comments) plus the sibling
# `check_issue_contract`/`merge_readiness` budgets and a process-spawn
# margin, so the SAME arithmetic-break class of bug cannot recur here
# independently of the value chosen below. The fallback values below are
# kept generously above the pre-#2165-fix layered ceiling (310s) so a
# caller that forgets to pass explicit deadlines still fails safe rather
# than reintroducing the original bug.
#
# Retry policy (OWNER 2026-08-14/2026-08-15 review): resubmitting the SAME
# deterministic checker command against the SAME pinned Issue body cannot
# change the outcome of a `timeout` classification -- the VC itself is what
# is over budget, not the process spawn/IPC layer -- so `retry_matrix()`
# below excludes `timeout` from the deterministic backend's retryable set
# (P1-3: the deterministic backend's retryable set is now a closed
# allowlist of transport-layer-only reason codes -- `spawn_failure`,
# `signal`, `capture_failure` -- not "every reason_code except timeout").
# This means the deterministic backend effectively gets ONE full-length
# attempt for a VC-execution-budget failure. Other backends (`claude`) keep
# retrying on timeout, since an LLM session hang is plausibly transient in a
# way a deterministic subprocess budget overrun is not.
#
# TOTAL_DEADLINE_SECONDS stays >= PER_ATTEMPT_DEADLINE_SECONDS (+40s margin)
# so a single full-length attempt is never starved of its own per-attempt
# budget by `min(per_attempt_deadline, total_deadline - elapsed)`; the
# margin covers a small number of fast (`spawn_failure` etc.) retries that
# remain possible for other reason codes, bounded further by
# `MIN_RETRY_ATTEMPT_BUDGET_FRACTION` below (P1-1 marge condition 8): a
# retry is never spawned once the time remaining before `total_deadline`
# drops below that fraction of the PER-ATTEMPT budget.
PER_ATTEMPT_DEADLINE_SECONDS = 480
TOTAL_DEADLINE_SECONDS = 520
# Issue #2165 P1-1 marge condition 8: the minimum time budget that must
# remain before `total_deadline`, expressed as a FRACTION of
# `per_attempt_deadline` (not an absolute constant), for a NEW (2nd/3rd)
# attempt to be spawned at all -- covers process spawn + a minimal useful
# execution slice + cleanup. A fraction (rather than a fixed number of
# seconds) scales correctly across very different `per_attempt_deadline`
# magnitudes: the deterministic backend's real ~480s per-attempt budget
# needs tens of seconds of headroom to be worth retrying, while a
# short-deadline caller (e.g. a test using a 1s per-attempt budget) needs
# only a proportionally small headroom, not the same fixed floor. If the
# remaining total-deadline budget is smaller than this fraction of the
# per-attempt budget, spawning another attempt could not possibly complete

    silently accepted JSON ``true``/``false`` as a valid issue number or
    attempt. It also accepted an empty ``repository`` / ``invocation_id``
    string and applied no positive-value constraint. This revision uses
    exact ``type(x) is int`` checks (rejecting ``bool``), a ``>= 1``
    constraint on both integer fields, the canonical owner/repo format regex
    already defined by ``command_registry._OWNER_REPO_RE`` (reused, not
    duplicated), and the canonical invocation-id token format already
    defined by this module's own ``_ATTEMPT`` regex (the same format
    ``artifact_relative_path()`` already enforces on write).

    NOTE: this function is used ONLY to validate the SHAPE of an artifact's
    own embedded binding fields (schema-conformance gate). It is never used
    to derive "expected" values for a binding comparison against itself --
    see Issue #2242 Blocker 2 / ``run_root_review_pipeline.readback_persisted_artifact()``,
    which now requires the caller to supply independent expected binding
    values and delegates the actual comparison to :func:`verify_artifact`.
