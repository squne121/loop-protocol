run_root_review_pipeline.py - ROOT_REVIEW_PIPELINE_RESULT_V1

Root-owned producer I/O for the issue-refinement-loop review step (Issue #2049).

Problem this closes: the `issue-reviewer` custom agent
(`.codex/agents/issue-reviewer.toml`) declares `default_permissions =
"loop-protocol-readonly"` (read-only) while its historical
`developer_instructions` also required it to fetch the live Issue body,
write temp files, and persist a full artifact under
`.claude/artifacts/issue-refinement-loop/<N>/` -- a producer I/O
responsibility a read-only agent cannot legitimately carry out. This module
moves ALL of that producer I/O (live body fetch, body SHA pin, checker
execution, artifact persistence, child-stdout classification, and
readback/verdict-identity gating of the "final review" step) into a single
root-owned script that the orchestrator (main thread / `issue-refinement-loop`
SKILL.md Step 2), not the read-only agent, invokes directly.

Historical note, superseded by the Issue #2380 paragraph immediately below:
prior to Issue #2380, the `issue-reviewer` agent's role after the above
change was advisory-relay -- it read the already-pinned merged review
result this script produces and returned an `ISSUE_REVIEW_RESULT_COMPACT_V1`
verdict on stdout, performing no I/O of its own. That relay is no longer
part of the canonical routing path.

Issue #2380: canonical Step 2 routing (`issue-refinement-loop` SKILL.md) does
NOT invoke the `issue-reviewer` agent, does not relay `compact_result.stdout_lines`
to it, and does not call `classify_child_stdout()` /
`retry_once_on_transport_failure()` (both defined below). Canonical Step 2
consumes `produce`'s own root-verified `compact_result.verdict` /
`compact_result.next_action` (and `verified_transport_artifact`) directly.
The `issue-reviewer` agent, `classify-child-stdout` CLI subcommand,
`classify_child_stdout()`, and `retry_once_on_transport_failure()` remain
available for legacy CLI / diagnostic / regression-test use (they still
enforce the exact 11-line V2 wire grammar as a strict compatibility
boundary -- see `validate_review_compact_output.py`), but they are no
longer part of the canonical routing path.

CLI subcommands:

    produce             Fetch + pin live body, run checkers, and act as the
                         SOLE producer of BOTH the ROOT_REVIEW_PIPELINE_RESULT_V1
                         canonical artifact AND the ISSUE_REVIEW_RESULT_COMPACT_V1
                         compact envelope + its persisted artifact (PR #2135

                         only the checker/readiness/merge artifacts were
                         root-owned and the compact envelope was left to a
                         "read-only" child that could not legitimately write
                         it). The compact envelope's rendered stdout lines are
                         returned to the caller as `compact_result.stdout_lines`
                         (legacy CLI / diagnostic / regression-test use only),

                         direct-consume routing input (Issue #2380). Canonical
                         Step 2 does not hand `compact_result.stdout_lines` to the
                         read-only `issue-reviewer` child; that agent is not
                         invoked as part of canonical Step 2 routing at all.

Persistence (Issue #2049 AC3, PR #2135 iteration-3 P1-3): both
`persist_to_canonical_artifact_directory()` and the compact-envelope artifact
this module now also persists reuse `compact_review_result._atomic_write()`
(the hardened `mkstemp()` + 0600 + symlink-recheck primitive already used by
`compact_review_result.py`, added by PR #1907) instead of a separately
reimplemented weaker writer, and include a run-unique (`pid` + `uuid4`)
filename component so two concurrent sessions processing the same Issue in
the same second cannot collide on either the temp or the final artifact path.

Intermediate files (Issue #2049 AC-adjacent, PR #2135 iteration-3 P2-6): all
invocation-private intermediate files (`body_file`, `*.review_result.json`,
`*.readiness_result.json`, `*.merged_review_result.json`) are created inside a
`tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` for the lifetime of a single `produce` call
and removed automatically when that call returns (success or error); only the
canonical artifact(s) explicitly persisted via
`persist_to_canonical_artifact_directory()` survive the call.

Architecture delta relative to #1875 (PR #2135 iteration-3 P1-4): #1875
removed replay/digest/persistent-state machinery to keep the loop bounded on
live Issue body + a minimal verdict, and explicitly avoided adding new
schemas/digests/receipts/state machines or gating review on artifact
freshness/validity. This module's persisted `ROOT_REVIEW_PIPELINE_RESULT_V1`
/ compact artifacts remain a deliberate, narrow exception scoped to Issue
#2049's own AC3/AC7/AC10 (proving root-owned producer I/O and a final-review
gate keyed on a *freshly regenerated-this-call* artifact, not a stale
long-lived receipt): every artifact this module persists is produced and
consumed within the SAME `produce` invocation's live-body fetch, never
carried over from a prior run, and `gate_final_review()` only ever reads back
the artifact this same call just wrote. Consumer: `issue-refinement-loop`
SKILL.md Step 2 (orchestrator), which consumes `compact_result.verdict` /
`compact_result.next_action` / `verified_transport_artifact` directly (Issue
#2380) -- the `issue-reviewer` agent is NOT a canonical Step 2 consumer of
this schema; it remains a legacy CLI / diagnostic / regression-test-only
reader of `compact_result.stdout_lines` when invoked outside canonical
routing. No other skill/orchestrator step depends on this schema. If Issue #2049's AC7/AC10 wording itself needs to
change to fold this back into #1875's stale-tolerant minimal-harness model, that is a separate Issue-contract
decision, not one this PR makes unilaterally.

    A 0-byte stdout is ALWAYS classified (validator-first, never silently
    dropped) as `empty_input` / `reviewer_transport_failure`: the root
    producer may retry the child invocation exactly once (see

    Issue #2242 OWNER adversarial review
    (https://github.com/squne121/loop-protocol/pull/2246#issuecomment-5328161000),
    Blocker 2 + Blocker 3:

    Blocker 2 (AC4 binding verification was self-referential/tautological):
    the previous revision read `repository`/`issue_number`/`invocation_id`/
    `attempt` OUT of the artifact itself via `extract_binding_context()`,
    then compared those SAME values back against the artifact as "expected"
    values -- a comparison that can never fail except accidentally via
    `body_sha256` (`payload["x"] == payload["x"]`). This revision requires
    the CALLER to supply every expected binding value independently
    (`expected_repo` / `expected_issue` / `expected_invocation_id` /
    `expected_attempt` / `expected_artifact_sha256`, sourced from the
    orchestrator's own known repo/issue/invocation/attempt context -- never
    re-derived from the artifact being verified) and passes them straight
    through to `reviewer_transport.verify_artifact()`.

    Blocker 3 (custom insecure symlink-following file open instead of full
    delegation): the previous revision implemented its own
    `os.open(path, O_NOFOLLOW)` + custom 10 MiB size cap + custom read loop.
    `O_NOFOLLOW` on a single flat `os.open()` call only rejects a symlink at
    the LEAF path component -- it does NOT reject symlinks in intermediate
    path components, so a symlinked parent directory could smuggle in an
    out-of-root regular file. This revision deletes that reimplementation
    entirely and fully delegates the open+read+hash+binding-verify to
    `reviewer_transport.verify_artifact()`, which anchors traversal via
    `artifact_root` + a validated repo-relative `artifact_relative` path,
    applies `O_DIRECTORY|O_NOFOLLOW` on EVERY intermediate path component
    (not just the leaf), enforces a 1 MiB cap
    (`reviewer_transport.ARTIFACT_MAX_BYTES`), computes SHA-256 over the
    same raw bytes, and independently verifies binding. No parallel
    open/read/hash logic is reimplemented in this module.

    `_classify_verify_artifact_failure()` translates `verify_artifact()`'s
    internal `reason_code` vocabulary into this function's pre-existing
    external violation vocabulary (presentation layer only -- see that
    function's docstring).

    Checks (all must pass for `verdict_identity: true`):
      1. `artifact_root`/`artifact_relative` open (dir-fd-anchored,
         component-wise no-follow) as a regular file within the 1 MiB cap.
      2. File content parses as strict JSON via the SAME raw bytes read once.
      3. The parsed payload is a `REVIEWER_COMPACT_ARTIFACT_V2` object whose
         raw-byte SHA-256 matches `expected_artifact_sha256` exactly.
      4. The artifact's `repository` / `issue_number` / `reviewed_body_sha256`
         / `invocation_id` / `attempt` fields ALL match the caller-supplied
         `expected_repo` / `expected_issue` / `expected_body_sha256` /
         `expected_invocation_id` / `expected_attempt` exactly
         (`reviewer_transport.check_artifact_binding()`).
      5. The artifact's nested `semantic_result` validates against the FULL
         `REVIEW_ISSUE_RESULT_V1` jsonschema
         (`reviewer_transport.validate_semantic_result_schema()`, Issue #2242
         Blocker 4 -- not merely `verdict`/`blocking_issues` presence).
      6. The artifact's nested `semantic_result.verdict` (extracted via
         `reviewer_transport.semantic_verdict_and_count()`, never a locally
         reimplemented `semantic_result` field-map) matches

def route_canonical_step2_result(result: Any) -> str:
    """Canonical Step 2's SOLE routing decision function (Issue #2380 P0-2).

    A prior implementation iteration keyed routing off `compact_result.verdict`
    alone (`approve` -> Step 4.5, `needs-fix` -> Step 4), silently ignoring
    `compact_result.next_action`. That is a functional bug: `compact_result`
    can in principle carry a `verdict: needs-fix` + `next_action:
    human_judgment_required` shape (the `STEP_5_HUMAN_JUDGMENT_REQUIRED`
    branch below exists to route that exact triple, kept from Issue #2389
    for exhaustiveness), so ignoring `next_action` entirely would route it
    into the ordinary rewrite loop (Step 4) as if it were a plain
    `needs-fix`.

    IMPORTANT (Issue #2397 P2-1 -- retired design corrected here): an
    earlier iteration of this docstring, and of `check_issue_contract.py`'s
    own docstrings, described `compact_review_result.py` / `build_compact_v2()`
    as DERIVING that `next_action: human_judgment_required` wire value FROM
    the readiness checker's `failure_class`. That design was proposed,
    reviewed, and explicitly REJECTED by the OWNER (Issue #2397 anchor
    comment P0-3): the Compact V2 wire's `NEXT_ACTION` stays the two-valued
    `proceed | request_changes` contract from Issue #2054, unchanged, and
    `build_compact_v2()` / `validate_compact_v2()` never read or emit
    `failure_class` at all. The readiness checker's `contract_readiness_
    human_judgment` `failure_class` (environment/tool/timeout/unknown-
    classification, NOT a body-rewrite-fixable contract defect) is instead
    surfaced to THIS root-owned function directly, by reading
    `merged_review_result.failure_class` from the SAME producer payload --
    see the `STEP_5_OPERATOR_INTERVENTION_REQUIRED` branch below (Issue
    #2397 P0-1/P0-2). The `next_action == "human_judgment_required"` branch
    immediately below is unrelated to `failure_class` and is never actually
    populated by the real two-valued wire; it remains only as a defensive,
    independently-tested terminal case for a `compact_result` shape this
    function does not otherwise assume is impossible.

    This function evaluates the FULL `(status, verdict, next_action)` triple
    -- exactly the outcomes the Issue #2380 / #2389 fix_delta specify -- and
    is intentionally pure (no I/O, no SubAgent/CLI invocation of any kind):
    it only inspects `result` (typically `_cmd_produce()`'s own parsed JSON
    output, but any object with the same shape works, which is what makes it
    independently unit-testable). It is a TOTAL function: `result` and its
    `compact_result` entry are validated to be `Mapping` instances before any
    attribute access, so malformed/non-dict input (`list`, `str`, `int`,
    `None`, etc.) never raises `AttributeError` -- it falls through to the
    fail-closed return below instead (Issue #2389 P1-1 / AC4).

        result is not a Mapping, OR `compact_result` is present and is not
        a Mapping
            -> `FAIL_CLOSED_ENVIRONMENT_OR_INTEGRITY_FAILURE` (never raises)
        status == ok + verdict == approve   + next_action == proceed
            -> Step 2.5 (`STEP_2_5`; Issue #2389 -- a deterministic approve
               must still pass through the Step 2.5 semantic design review
               applicability gate. Routing straight to `STEP_4_5` here would
               bypass that gate, which is exactly the defect Issue #2389
               closes: the routing table itself, not just prose telling the
               orchestrator to remember to check applicability separately.)
        status == ok + verdict == needs-fix + next_action == request_changes
            -> Step 4 (`STEP_4`) by default, UNLESS the SAME payload's
               verified `merged_review_result.failure_class` is exactly
               `"contract_readiness_human_judgment"` (Issue #2397), in
               which case it routes to
               `STEP_5_OPERATOR_INTERVENTION_REQUIRED` instead (see below).
               This does NOT touch the compact V2 wire (`next_action`
               stays the two-valued `proceed | request_changes` contract
               from Issue #2054) -- `merged_review_result` is the full,
               already-merged `REVIEW_ISSUE_RESULT_V1` payload this SAME
               producer call places alongside `compact_result` in its own
               stdout JSON, not a wire field.
        status == ok + verdict == needs-fix + next_action ==
            human_judgment_required (EXACT triple match only -- Issue #2389
            PR #2391 OWNER review P1-1: a loose match on `next_action` alone

            `verdict: approve` + `next_action: human_judgment_required`,

            condition, not a genuine semantic/owner-ambiguity judgment call
            (that is what `STEP_5_HUMAN_JUDGMENT_REQUIRED` above is for).
            When `merged_review_result` is missing, `None`, or its
            `failure_class` is missing/`None`, this branch falls through to
            the ordinary `STEP_4` result unchanged (Issue #2397 AC2). When
            `merged_review_result` is present but not a `Mapping`, or
            `failure_class` is a non-empty string other than
            `"contract_readiness_human_judgment"`, this fails closed instead
            (Issue #2397 AC3) -- an unrecognized/malformed `failure_class`

    This is intentionally a second, separate pure function rather than
    folding the extra fields into `route_canonical_step2_result()` itself:
    `route_canonical_step2_result()`'s contract is "return exactly one of
    the known route string constants" (unit-tested directly against those
    constants across AC1-AC4), and callers other than `_emit_produce_result()`
    (e.g. `test_canonical_step2_route_wiring.py`) rely on that narrow
    contract unchanged. `build_canonical_step2_disposition()` takes that
    SAME route string as its only input and has no I/O of its own.

    Only the `STEP_5_OPERATOR_INTERVENTION_REQUIRED` route is terminal from
    this disposition's point of view: it carries `terminal: true` plus the
    fixed `termination_reason` / `termination_cause` pair the orchestrator
    (`issue-refinement-loop/references/termination-policy.md`) uses to
    distinguish an operator-intervention stop from an ordinary in-loop route
    (Step 2.5 / Step 4 / Step 5 human-judgment) or a fail-closed integrity
    stop. Every other route (including `FAIL_CLOSED_ENVIRONMENT_OR_INTEGRITY_FAILURE`
    and `STEP_5_HUMAN_JUDGMENT_REQUIRED`, which have their own distinct
    termination handling elsewhere and are unchanged by this Issue) gets
