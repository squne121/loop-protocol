"""dependency_materializer.py — Issue #2435.

Single common dependency-materialization choke point for issue-refinement-loop.

## Background

Issue #2424's refinement completed with three confirmed hard predecessors
recorded only as Issue-body prose (a human-readable mirror/fallback). The
GitHub native predecessor relationship (SSOT per `docs/dev/github-ops.md`)
was never materialized, so a later live readback found it empty while the
body still claimed the predecessors were tracked. This module exists so
that no production lane (trusted human context, trusted anchor, controlled
reframe, or the #2406 confirmed-hard-predecessor route) can report a hard
dependency as "recorded" without an accompanying, independently-verified
native materialization.

## Scope (Issue #2435)

This module is a producer + materializer, not a new mutation surface:

- The *producer* functions project an already-confirmed
  ``ISSUE_EXECUTION_DECISION_V1`` semantic decision (``relations[]`` with
  ``relation_type == "depends_on"`` and ``execution.predecessors[]``) into a
  desired native-predecessor set for a single target Issue. They never
  invent a new dependency-classification rule; they only read a decision
  that some other trusted lane already confirmed.
- The *materializer* functions turn a desired set (plus an explicit,
  caller-declared stale-predecessor removal list) into the existing
  ``.claude/skills/edit-issue/scripts/edit_issue_txn.py`` /
  ``issue_relationship.update`` controlled-executor request. No GraphQL/REST
  call to GitHub's dependency endpoints is made directly by this module;
  every remote read or write is delegated to ``edit_issue_txn.py`` (AC10).

Removal is **never** derived from "live native state minus desired state"
(a full-set-replace computation would silently drop an unrelated,
pre-existing native predecessor nobody in this pipeline ever confirmed --
see ``derive_stale_predecessors`` and the AC7(b) regression fixture). It is
always the explicit set-difference between two *confirmed decision*
snapshots (previous vs current), or an explicit caller-declared list.

## Failure classification (AC8)

``classify_materialization_failure`` distinguishes:

- ``native-capability-unavailable``: the ``gh`` binary itself is missing.
- ``auth-or-environment-failure``: ``gh`` is present but auth/network is
  unreachable (routine/retryable environment failure -- never converted
  into an unnecessary human approval, but also never reported as success).
- ``controlled-executor-failure``: the ``issue_relationship.update``
  controlled executor itself failed (transport, receipt loss, etc.).
- ``readback-mismatch``: a live readback did not match the expected
  postcondition (drift before or after mutation).
- ``semantic-human-judgment-required``: a graph-invariant violation or a
  forwarded ``human_judgment`` readiness status -- a genuine judgment call,
  not a retryable environment failure.

## Reuse by other lanes (AC9)

Every public function here is a plain, side-effect-free (or clearly-scoped
I/O) callable with an explicit, injectable collaborator boundary
(``capability_preflight`` / ``fetch_live_predecessors`` /
``invoke_edit_issue_txn``). The #2406 confirmed-hard-predecessor route (or
any future lane) can import and call ``materialize_dependencies`` directly
without needing its own copy of the delta/postcondition logic, and without
colliding with this module's own callers.

## Readiness consumption, not re-computation (P1, OWNER review on PR #2447)

``materialize_dependencies`` never invokes ``contract_readiness_check.py``
itself. It only forwards whatever ``readiness_result`` the caller already
computed earlier in the same refinement cycle (e.g. the existing Step 4
pre-edit static readiness check, or the Final Gate's confirmed
``CONTRACT_REVIEW_RESULT_V1.status == "go"``) to
``edit_issue_txn.py``'s existing ``readiness_forwarding_payload`` contract.
This module previously ran its own ``contract_readiness_check.py``
subprocess and mapped that subprocess's own non-JSON/crash output to
``status: input_or_runtime_error``, which ``edit_issue_txn.py`` then folds
into an overall ``status: human_judgment`` -- turning a routine, retryable
failure inside *this module's own* readiness re-check into an unnecessary
human-judgment escalation. Removing the internal re-check removes that
failure mode entirely: a caller-supplied ``readiness_result`` whose own
``status`` is genuinely ``human_judgment`` / ``input_or_runtime_error`` (a
real signal from the workflow's own readiness pipeline, not a crash inside
this module) is still correctly classified as
``semantic-human-judgment-required`` via
``_FAILURE_CLASS_BY_ERROR_CODE["readiness_forwarding_requires_human_judgment"]``.

## Step 5 termination gate (P0, OWNER review on PR #2447)

``evaluate_termination_dependency_gate`` is the single production choke
point the ``issue-refinement-loop`` Step 5 termination path calls before
posting an ``approved`` / ``LOOP_HANDOFF_RESULT_V1`` termination for a
cycle where a hard dependency was confirmed via any production lane
(trusted human context, trusted anchor, controlled reframe, or the #2406
confirmed-hard-predecessor route). Without this wiring, adding the
producer/materializer alone left the #2424 defect this Issue exists to fix
fully reproducible after merge (the choke point existed but nothing in the
real termination path ever called it). See
``references/termination-policy.md`` (Dependency Materialization Gate) for
the mandatory Step 5 invocation contract.

    Projects ``current_execution_decision`` (this cycle's confirmed
    ``ISSUE_EXECUTION_DECISION_V1``) via ``derive_desired_predecessors``,
    calls ``materialize_dependencies``, and folds the body-only

    - ``decision: block_retryable`` -- a transient auth/environment or
      controlled-executor failure (``_RETRYABLE_FAILURE_CLASSES``). The
      orchestrator should bounded-retry, never escalate to a human on this
      alone.
    - ``decision: block_persistent`` -- a readback mismatch, a genuine
      ``semantic-human-judgment-required`` signal, native capability being
      fundamentally unavailable, or a detected body-only false-green
      (AC5). The orchestrator MUST NOT post the ``approved`` termination
