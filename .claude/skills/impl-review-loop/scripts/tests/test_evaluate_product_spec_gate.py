Unit tests for evaluate_product_spec_gate.py

Fixture-driven test suite covering all required AC7 fixture cases:
- pass (applicability=applicable, decision=pass)

- fail (decision=fail)
- human_judgment (decision=human_judgment)
- missing-schema (product/spec trigger present but product_spec_check absent)
